# Lockdown Manager

This project is basically inspired by the Build for Sustainable Development Goals initiative.
In the case of a total lockdown, there would be need for a system to take record of those in essential services who shall be allowed to move out of the house.
There'd also be need for a system where if you need to go out (e.g. for groceries, to the supermarket... etc.), you'll have to register yourself. Such a system shall require you to input your personal details (i.e.: ID No, Phone, Full names as in National ID, email, password, pinned location of where you live, pinned location of where you need to go). 
The system shall _not allow more than 3 individuals_ to be out of the house at the same time _within a 100-meter radius_. The system shall also _not allow more than 3 people within a 100-meter radius at the destination_. For basic services such as groceries and shopping, the system _shall not allow any individual to be outside for more than 1 hour and for a distance of not more than 1 kilometer_.
There shall be a government login side where the police officers in surveillance shall log in and verify your permit if found outside. They can use either your phone or ID No to verify you’ve been allowed to be outside

## Summary

1.You can not be outside for basic services for more than 1hr and more than 1KM
2.No more than 3 people outside within a 100m radius in homes or destinations at the same time (you can add recommendation timings here as well)
3.People in essential services can register once and be allowed to be outdoors at any time
4.Police can log in to verify you’ve been permitted to be outside
